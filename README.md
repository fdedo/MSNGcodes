In this repository you can find some codes developed for the paper **F. De Domenico, G. Livan, G. Montagna, O. Nicrosini, Modeling and simulation of financial returns under non-Gaussian distributions, Physica A (2023)**.

- In _berryesseen.py_ the computation of the Monte Carlo bound for the **Berry-Esseen theorem** is implemented. 
  To run the code, the file _tldrandomnumbers.txt_ is provided in an external Drive folder. This file stores 10^8 random numbers 
  extracted from the Truncated LÃ©vy distribution with zero mean and variance equal to one over the bounded region [-30,30], with        parameter alpha = 1.5, lambda = 0.18, gamma = 0.4.


- In _mfpt.py_ you can find an example of the computation of the **first mean passage time** (mFPT). This variable gives information
  about the first time a stochastic process hits a specific threshold U starting from a fixed initial value. 
  As above, it is necessary to download the file _tldrandomnumbers.txt_ to correctly implement a comparison between the Gaussian and 
  non-Gaussian scenarios, as reported in the paper.
